# World-Layoff-Data-Cleaning-Project

This project was simply about taking a dataset and cleaning it to be used for data analysis.
It involved using basic, and intermediate functions of MySQL, to the likes of which I am getting familiar with. 

I do want to state that this project is NOT an original creation of mine, but rather a project based off a tutorial from AlexTheAnalyst on YouTube. 
If you want to check out his tutorial, here it is: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/Portfolio%20Project%20-%20Data%20Cleaning.sql

I am fairly new at using MySQL so I felt as if this would have been a good project to start off, especially as a 'code along'. I feel a bit more confident with my skills, and I feel like trying a new project within the similar data cleaning style
but with a new data set. 

I will say that this was extremely fun, exciting, and confusing. I'm excited to keep going on this path.

The project used a dataset from Kaggle "World_Layoffs_2022", and the only goal was to just clean it up.
This meant changing formats of data, formating the titles, removing blank rows, dealing with null rows, and so on.
Inside the file, I've tried to break down every step in their own sections
1. Removing Dupes
2. Standarized Data
3. Null Data
4. Removing Data
